first version will take voice input from mic with computer speech recogniton and feedback with pyttsx3 - Turk nov. 10

first version was using user input form mic but NLP was too sensetive so it was changed to user input through terminal and computer speech feedback as the game is played. the version as of nov 17 was changed and the recent post has update to write out the word as the user guesses correctly, before it was just saying good guess and then moving on. - Turk nov.18
